 abstract = {A method for calculating vectors of smallest norm in a given lattice is outlined. The norm is defined by means of a convex, compact, and symmetric subset of the given space. The main tool is the systematic use of the dual lattice. The method generalizes an algorithm presented by Coveyou and MacPherson, and improved by Knuth, for the determination of vectors of smallest Euclidean norm.},
